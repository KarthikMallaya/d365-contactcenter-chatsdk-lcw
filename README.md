### 🟢 Layer 1: Core Chat Widget (For Customers & Production)

**This is what you need if you're deploying to end users.**

The core layer connects directly to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Center using the official Omnichannel Chat SDK. It provides:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ✅ Real-time chat | Connect with Copilot Studio bots and live agents |
| ✅ File attachments | Send/receive images and documents |
| ✅ Adaptive Cards | Rich interactive content from your bot |
| ✅ Typing indicators | See when agents are responding |
| ✅ Queue management | Display wait times and position |
| ✅ Email transcript | Send conversation history to customers |
| ✅ Voice input | Speech-to-text messaging |
| ✅ Text-to-speech | Read responses aloud for accessibility |

**How to use Layer 1:**

1. Host the widget on your web server (Azure, etc.)
2. Configure your branding in **Dynamics 365 Admin Center** (logo, colors, welcome message)
3. Pass only the required parameters:
   ```
   https://your-hosted-widget.com/?orgId=xxx&orgUrl=xxx&widgetId=xxx
   ```
4. The widget connects to your Omnichannel instance and uses your D365 configured branding

**This is the production-ready path for customer deployments.**

---

### 🔵 Layer 2: Dynamic Branding & Demo Capabilities (For Microsoft & Partners)

**This is designed for internal demos, partner showcases, and rapid prototyping.**

We built an additional layer on top of the core widget specifically to help **Microsoft teams, partners, and sales engineers** demonstrate the product quickly without needing to configure a full D365 environment for each customer demo.

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| 🎨 Dynamic logo extraction | Pass `?company=contoso.com` and we fetch their logo automatically |
| 🌈 Automatic color theming | Colors are extracted from the logo to brand the entire UI |
| 🎯 URL parameter overrides | Customize colors via `?primaryColor=#0078D4` |
| 🧩 Chrome Extension | Inject the widget onto ANY website for live demos |
| 📱 PWA icons | Dynamic app icons for "Add to Home Screen" demos |
| 🤖 AI follow-up questions | Demo feature showing AI-powered suggestions |

**How Layer 2 works:**

```
https://your-hosted-widget.com/?orgId=xxx&orgUrl=xxx&widgetId=xxx&company=microsoft.com
                                                                    ↑
                                                    This triggers Layer 2 magic:
                                                    • Fetches Microsoft's logo
                                                    • Extracts brand colors
                                                    • Themes the entire widget
```

**The Chrome Extension** allows you to:
1. Visit any customer's website
2. Click the extension icon
3. The chat widget appears on their site with their branding
4. Perfect for "imagine this on your website" demos

### 📋 Quick Reference: Which Layer Do I Need?

| I am a... | I want to... | Use |
|-----------|--------------|-----|
| **Customer** | Deploy chat widget to my users | **Layer 1 only** — Configure branding in D365 Admin |
| **Customer** | Quickly test the widget | **Layer 1** — Use required params only |
| **Microsoft/Partner** | Demo to a prospect | **Layer 2** — Use `?company=` for instant branding |
| **Microsoft/Partner** | Show widget on customer's website | **Layer 2 + Chrome Extension** |
| **Developer** | Customize and extend | Fork repo, modify as needed |

### 🔄 Agent Switching (UI Demo - Implementation Pending)

> ⚠️ **Partial Implementation**: The agent switching UI is fully functional, but the backend routing to different Omnichannel workstreams has **not been implemented yet**. Currently, switching agents only updates the UI state and shows a toast notification.

The widget displays a panel for switching between different support topics:
- General Support
- Technical Support
- Sales & Products
- Billing & Account
- Feedback & Suggestions
- Urgent Assistance

**What's Implemented:**
- ✅ Agent selection UI panel
- ✅ Dynamic agent list loading from Power Automate (`agentsUrl`)
- ✅ Visual state management and toast notifications

**What Needs Implementation:**
- ❌ Connecting to different Omnichannel workstreams (different `widgetId` values)
- ❌ Ending current chat session and starting new one with different widget
- ❌ Preserving context/transcript when switching

**Intended Behavior (for contributors):**

Each "agent" should map to a different **Chat Widget ID** in Dynamics 365 Omnichannel, routing users to different queues/workstreams:

```typescript
// Example: Agent to Widget mapping (not yet implemented)
const agentWidgetMapping = {
  "general": "widget-id-for-general-queue",
  "technical": "widget-id-for-tech-support-queue",
  "sales": "widget-id-for-sales-queue",
  "billing": "widget-id-for-billing-queue"
};

// When user switches agent, the app should:
// 1. End current chat session
// 2. Reinitialize SDK with new widgetId
// 3. Start new chat session with the appropriate queue
```

**Dynamic Agents via Power Automate:**

You can provide a custom agent list by passing an `agentsUrl` parameter:
```
?agentsUrl=https://your-flow.azure.com/api/agents
```

Expected response format:
```json
{
  "agents": [
    { "id": "support", "name": "Customer Support", "description": "General help", "icon": "" },
    { "id": "tech", "name": "Technical Team", "description": "Technical issues", "icon": "" }
  ]
}
```

### 🤖 AI-Powered Follow-Up Questions (Demo Feature)

> ⚠️ **Demo Feature**: The follow-up question generation is included as a demonstration. The default `pauUrl` points to a sample Power Automate flow that may not be available. **Contributors should implement their own endpoint.**

After each bot response, the widget can fetch AI-generated follow-up questions to help users continue the conversation. This feature calls an HTTP endpoint (typically a Power Automate flow or Azure Function) that returns suggested questions.

#### Expected JSON Response Format

Your endpoint should return JSON in one of these formats:

**Option 1: Array property (recommended)**
```json
{
  "questions": [
    { "item": "How do I reset my password?" },
    { "item": "What are your business hours?" }
  ]
}
```

**Option 2: Simple string array**
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    "How do I reset my password?",
    "What are your business hours?"
  ]
}
```

The widget extracts the first array found in the response and displays up to 2 questions.

#### Request Payload

Your endpoint receives a POST request with:
```json
{
  "botResponse": "The last message from the bot/agent",
  "companyName": "contoso.com",
  "url": "contoso.com"
}
```

#### Configuration

Pass your endpoint URL via the `pauUrl` query parameter:
```
?pauUrl=https://your-function.azurewebsites.net/api/generate-questions
```

**Implementation Ideas:**
- Azure Function with Azure OpenAI
- Power Automate flow with AI Builder
- Custom API with any LLM provider

## 🌐 Hosting & Deployment

This chat widget is a **static web application** that must be hosted on a web server to function. It cannot run as a local file due to browser security restrictions and the need to communicate with Dynamics 365 APIs.

### Recommended Hosting Options

| Platform | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Azure Static Web Apps** | Free tier available, global CDN, custom domains | Production deployments |
| **Azure App Service** | Full web app hosting with SSL | Enterprise deployments |
| **Azure Blob Storage** | Static website hosting, very low cost | Simple deployments |
| **GitHub Pages** | Free hosting for public repos | Demo/testing |
| **Vercel / Netlify** | Free tier, automatic deployments | Quick prototyping |

### Deployment Steps

1. **Build the production bundle:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `dist/` folder** to your hosting platform

3. **Configure your domain** in Dynamics 365:
   - Go to **Customer Service admin center** → **Channels** → **Chat**
   - Add your hosted domain to the **Allowed origins** list

### Environment Considerations

- **HTTPS Required**: Omnichannel SDK requires secure connections
- **CORS**: Your hosting domain must be whitelisted in D365 admin center
- **Custom Domain**: Recommended for production use with SSL certificate

### Example: Azure Static Web Apps Deployment

```bash
# Install Azure SWA CLI
npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli

# Build the app
npm run build

# Deploy to Azure
swa deploy ./dist --env production
```

## 🧩 Chrome Extension

The included Chrome extension allows injecting the chat widget into any website.

### Installation

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `chrome-extension` folder
5. Configure your Omnichannel parameters in the extension popup
